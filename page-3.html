      laws and moral code, customs and calendar, history and tradition, aptitudes and ambitions;

       international law, we are a nation”</b>Quaid-E-Azam tried to understand all
       the Muslims that we all should be united and organized if we want a separate homeland.
       Quaid-E-Azam achieved a great  success in making the people understand about 
       the demand of separate homeland.For this purpose,he addressed many processions.

       the women under the platform of Muslim League.When all people were united,
       then Quaid-E-Azam started the struggle with his campanions.They started the 
       struggle in 1940 and in the the duration of seven years he achieved the separate 
       homeland.Chaudry Rehmat Ali suggested seven names for the state from which 
       <b>Pakistan</b> was selected .It means "land of the pure" in Urdu and Persian.
